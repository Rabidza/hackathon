# hackathon
This is just a spoofing site I created while taking part in our company's hackathon competion.

<h2>TODO:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get apache working, currently this is a mess.</li>
  <li>Clean up code and remove unnessary files</li>
  <li>Fix login screen to resize automatically (botched this during the hackathon...)</li>
</ul>
